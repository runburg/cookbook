## 💡 **Notes and Tips**
- **Nut Alternatives**: Swap pecans or walnuts for your favorite nut, or skip them for a nut-free option.  
- **Apple Type**: Tart apples like Granny Smith add a nice contrast, but any firm apple will work.  
- **Make it Fancy**: Top with whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for extra indulgence!
