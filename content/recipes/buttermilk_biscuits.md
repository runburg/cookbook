## 📝 **Ingredients**
- **3 cups flour**
- **1/2 tsp salt**
- **2 tsp baking powder**
- **1 tsp baking soda**
- **3/4 cup butter** - diced and frozen
- **1 cup buttermilk**
- **1/2 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt**

## 🔥 **Steps**
1. Preheat the oven to **400°F**.
2. Mix the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda.
3. In a food processor, cut in the butter to the flour mixture.
4. Add buttermilk and sour cream/Greek yogurt as the food processor is running.  The dough should form a rough, sticky ball. If it is still not coming together, slowly add ice water until the dough forms a ball.
5. Roll out the dough to be **1.5"–2" thick**.
6. Cut the biscuits into your preferred shape and place them on a baking sheet.
7. Bake for **20–25 minutes** until the tops are starting to brown.

## 💡 **Notes and Tips**
- If your dough is too dry, add small amounts of ice water slowly until it forms a ball.
- For fluffier biscuits, handle the dough as little as possible to avoid overworking it.
- Experiment with different biscuit shapes to make it more fun for kids!
