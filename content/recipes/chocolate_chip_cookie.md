## üìù **Ingredients**
- **4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour**
- **2 tsp kosher salt**
- **1 tsp baking soda**
- **1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter** - room temperature
- **2 cups dark brown sugar**
- **1 cup white sugar**
- **2 large eggs** - room temperature
- **1 large egg white** - room temperature
- **1 Tbsp vanilla extract**
- **15-20 oz bittersweet chocolate chips** - can substitute semi-sweet
- **Fleur de sel** - for topping

## üî• **Steps**
1. Preheat the oven to **350¬∞F** and line baking trays with **parchment paper or silicone mats**.  
2. In a bowl, combine the **dry ingredients** (flour, salt, baking soda) and mix together.  
3. In a stand mixer, **cream the butter and sugars** (brown and white) together on medium-high speed.  
4. Add the **eggs and egg white** one at a time, mixing on medium speed until just combined. Scrape down the bowl after each egg addition.  
5. On low speed, slowly add the **flour mixture** in batches until just combined.  
6. **Fold in the chocolate chips** by hand.  
7. If the dough becomes warm, **chill it in the freezer** for a few minutes to firm up.  
8. Use an **ice cream scoop** to scoop dough onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten slightly with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. Sprinkle a pinch of **fleur de sel** on top of each cookie.  
9. Chill the trays in the freezer for **5 minutes** before baking.  
10. Bake for **15 minutes**, rotating halfway through if baking multiple trays at once.  
11. Allow to cool on a **wire rack**.  

## üí° **Notes and Tips**
- **Chill the dough**: If the dough becomes too soft, chilling it before baking ensures the cookies stay thick and chewy.  
- **Even Baking**: Rotate trays halfway through baking to ensure even cooking.  
- **Fleur de sel**: This finishing touch of salt takes the flavor to the next level.
