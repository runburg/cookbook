## 📝 **Ingredients**
- **3 cups flour**
- **1.5 cups warm water**
- **1/8 - 1/4 tsp yeast**
- **1.5 tsp salt**

## 🔥 **Steps**
1. Mix ingredients and cover loosely.  
2. Let rise until double — preferably **overnight**.  
3. Turn dough a few times with a spatula and let rise a second time until doubled.  
4. Preheat Dutch oven to **450°F**.  
5. Once heated, sprinkle bottom with cornmeal, dump in dough, cover, and bake for **30 minutes**.  
6. Remove lid and bake for **2–3 minutes** until golden.  

## 💡 **Notes and Tips**
- For best results, allow for a long, overnight rise to develop better flavor.  
- Try adding seeds or herbs to the dough for added flavor.  
- Use parchment paper to avoid sticking if you don't want to use cornmeal.
