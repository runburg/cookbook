- **Thick Sauce**: Diced tomatoes may require more cooking time to reduce excess water.  
- **Balance Acidity**: If the tomato sauce tastes "tinny," add a tablespoon of **brown sugar** or a couple of **carrots** to combat the acidity.  
- **Spinach Tips**: Be sure to drain the spinach thoroughly to prevent excess moisture in the lasagna.
