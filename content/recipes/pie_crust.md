## 📝 **Ingredients**
- **2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour**
- **1 tsp salt** - or to taste
- **1 tsp sugar** - or to taste
- **1 cup cold, unsalted butter** - sliced and diced into small cubes
- **1/4 - 1/2 cup very cold water** - add gradually

## 🔥 **Steps**
1. Pulse **flour, salt, and sugar** in a food processor.  
2. Add **butter** and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal.  
3. Slowly add just enough **cold water** so the mixture starts to hold together.  
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball.  
5. Divide the dough into **two parts**.  
6. Wrap each dough ball tightly and refrigerate for at least **20 minutes**.  
7. Roll out the dough and line your pie plate as needed.  

## 💡 **Notes and Tips**
- **Make-Ahead Option**: This dough can be made **1-2 days in advance** or **frozen** for later use. If refrigerated, be sure to wrap tightly to prevent it from turning grey.  
- **Blind Baking**: If your recipe calls for a pre-baked crust, you can **pre-bake it** as needed.  
- **No Food Processor?**: Grate frozen butter sticks and hand-mix with the flour mixture. Be careful not to overhandle the dough, and ensure it stays chilled before rolling out.
