Mix the flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. In a food processor, cut in the butter to the flour mixture. Add buttermilk and sour cream/Greek yogurt as the food processor is running. The dough should form a rough, sticky ball. If it is still not coming together, slowly add ice water until the dough forms a ball. Roll out the dough to be 1.5\u0026quot;–2\u0026quot; thick. Cut the biscuits into your preferred shape and place them on a baking sheet. Bake for 20–25 minutes until the tops are starting to brown. 💡 Notes and Tips # If your dough is too dry, add small amounts of ice water slowly until it forms a ball. For fluffier biscuits, handle the dough as little as possible to avoid overworking it. Experiment with different biscuit shapes to make it more fun for kids!

In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients (flour, salt, baking soda) and mix together. In a stand mixer, cream the butter and sugars (brown and white) together on medium-high speed. Add the eggs and egg white one at a time, mixing on medium speed until just combined. Scrape down the bowl after each egg addition. On low speed, slowly add the flour mixture in batches until just combined. Fold in the chocolate chips by hand. If the dough becomes warm, chill it in the freezer for a few minutes to firm up. Use an ice cream scoop to scoop dough onto the prepared cookie sheets. Flatten slightly with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. Sprinkle a pinch of fleur de sel on top of each cookie. Chill the trays in the freezer for 5 minutes before baking. Bake for 15 minutes, rotating halfway through if baking multiple trays at once. Allow to cool on a wire rack. 💡 Notes and Tips # Chill the dough: If the dough becomes too soft, chilling it before baking ensures the cookies stay thick and chewy. Even Baking: Rotate trays halfway through baking to ensure even cooking. Fleur de sel: This finishing touch of salt takes the flavor to the next level.

Add butter and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Slowly add just enough cold water so the mixture starts to hold together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Divide the dough into two parts. Wrap each dough ball tightly and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes. Roll out the dough and line your pie plate as needed. 💡 Notes and Tips # Make-Ahead Option: This dough can be made 1-2 days in advance or frozen for later use. If refrigerated, be sure to wrap tightly to prevent it from turning grey. Blind Baking: If your recipe calls for a pre-baked crust, you can pre-bake it as needed. No Food Processor?: Grate frozen butter sticks and hand-mix with the flour mixture. Be careful not to overhandle the dough, and ensure it stays chilled before rolling out.

Add diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste, then season with rosemary, thyme, basil, balsamic, salt, and pepper. Simmer until the sauce reaches the desired thickness. Thaw and drain the frozen spinach, squeezing out excess moisture. If the ricotta is not dry, drain it as well. Combine ricotta, spinach, parmesan, mozzarella, and eggs in a mixing bowl. Cook lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, then pat them dry. Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a casserole tray, coat the bottom of the pan with a layer of sauce. Layer the lasagna: noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and repeat. Finish with a top layer of parmesan cheese.

Thick Sauce: Diced tomatoes may require more cooking time to reduce excess water. Balance Acidity: If the tomato sauce tastes \u0026ldquo;tinny,\u0026rdquo; add a tablespoon of brown sugar or a couple of carrots to combat the acidity. Spinach Tips: Be sure to drain the spinach thoroughly to prevent excess moisture in the lasagna.
